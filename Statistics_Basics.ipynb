        "**4.Data Transformations:-** Skewed data can often be transformed to make it more symmetrical, which can improve the validity of statistical analyses. Common transformations include logarithmic, square root, and reciprocal transformations.\n",

        "Ans:- The binomial distribution is a discrete probability distribution that describes the probability of obtaining a certain number of successes in a sequence of independent trials, where each trial has only two possible outcomes (success or failure).\n",

        "\n",
        "**2.Independent Trials:-** Each trial must be independent of the others. The outcome of one trial should not affect the outcome of any other trial. For example, if you flip a coin multiple times, the outcome of one flip doesn't change the probability of heads or tails on the next flip.\n",
        "\n",
        "**3.Two Possible Outcomes:-** Each trial must have only two possible outcomes: success or failure. These outcomes are mutually exclusive, meaning they cannot occur at the same time. For example, a coin flip can result in heads (success) or tails (failure).\n",
        "\n",
        "**4.Constant Probability of Success (p):-** The probability of success must remain the same for each trial. For example, if the probability of getting heads on a coin flip is 0.5, it should remain 0.5 for all flips.\n",
